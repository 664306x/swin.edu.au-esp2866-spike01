ESP2866 chip project, "Internet of Things"  
Software Development project - SWE30008  
Supervisor: Rajesh Vasa     
Client:     James Hamlyn-Harris  

This is a capstone project which involves presenting guidance for using the esp8266 chip. The ESP8266 is a very cheap (< $5 USD) device which has full wi-fi functionality, hardware interfaces and SOC.  It is young and whilst the community is developing fast, it is still not as widely adopted as alternatives like rasbery pie. Is small size and price make it potentially ideal for 'Internet of Things' applications.

The current version of the guide is in the project wiki, while the repository itself contains a mixture of code snippits. Some these are part of the guide, and some are other example projets, or work in progress projects. The guide is closed for submissions until the conclusion of our project, after which we are hoping to release it on an open content license such as CC-A.

Feel free to message us if you have any queries or want to provide feedback.

# ESP2866 chip project, "Internet of Things"  

Software Development project - SWE30008  
Supervisor: Rajesh Vasa     
Client:     James Hamlyn-Harris  

This is a capstone project which involves presenting guidance for using the esp8266 chip. The ESP8266 is a very cheap (< $5 USD) device which has full wi-fi functionality, hardware interfaces and SOC.  It is young and whilst the community is developing fast, it is still not as widely adopted as alternatives like rasbery pie. Is small size and price make it potentially ideal for 'Internet of Things' applications.

The current version of the guide is in the project wiki, while the repository itself contains a mixture of code snippits. Some these are part of the guide, and some are other example projets, or work in progress projects. The guide is closed for submissions until the conclusion of our project, after which we are hoping to release it on an open content license such as CC-A.

Feel free to message us if you have any queries or want to provide feedback.

###Home Security System
A Secrity Intrustion Detection System for ESP8266.

Author: Luke Jackson, 664306x  

####Aim  
To prototype and demonstrate the ESP8266 working as a motion detector server for home security (or just motion detection in some local).  
To example various abilities of the ESP8266 chip running NodeMCU.

####Features
- Use of a digital sensor.
- Use of the PWM functions.  
- Use of MQTT protocol.  

####Example Usage Scenario
- The system is installed in the home. If motion is detected a message is recieved on the home owners computer, notifing them there is moving in their home.
- The system presented is installed in the mailbox. When the mail arrives, a message is recived on the owners computer, notifying of the mail arrival.
- Someone wants to learn how to use MQTT (or other concepts covered) by example, so they follow the guide for this project on the WIKI.

####Planned Features / Expansion
- Disable alarm via code entry.
- Package into an application (init.lua)

####Open Issues and Bugs
- Unable to achieve functionality from a single power source.
- Wiki should be re-written, using proper single power source.
- Should be packaged into an application and init.lua.

####Code

###Music
A music Library for ESP8266.

Author: Luke Jackson, 664306x.  

####Aim
To provide an easy to use library that allows people using an ESP8266 chip running the NodeMCU firmware to use the PWM and a speaker to put of melodies. By using the library, people can have their internet of things devices that signal via audio to be more interesting, and useable. 

####Features

- Create a monophonic melody from the full western spectrum of music.
- 6 Octaves of range.
- Free timing.
- Dynamics.
- API

####Example Usage Scenarios
An esp8266 chip is installed in a toaster. When the toast has popped, the ESP8266 plays a fitting melody, such as the Zelda ‘get item’ melody. By using the music library, the Internet of Things toaster is a lot cooler than if it just buzzed.

####Open Issues & Bugs
-Dynamics function does not seem to be working.

####Planned Features / Expansion
- Better timing control (more abstracted / high level)

####Code
See 
- [music](https://github.com/664306x/swin.edu.au-esp8266/blob/master/music/music.lua)
- [usage example](https://github.com/664306x/swin.edu.au-esp8266/blob/master/music/usage.lua)

###Other
Does not contain any usefull code.  
Contains research conducted by the team about the problem space and possible solution, scope, deliverables and spikes.

####Spikes
A spike is a methodology for identidying and effeciently overcoming a knowledge gap. The team embraced spiking to solve many of the early knowledge gap, and the achieved knowledge is recorded in the outcomes here. These outcomes can be usefull for filling knowledge gaps on there topics.

####Guide pictures
Using Git to host the images used in the guide.

Software Development project - esp2866 chip project 

This is a capstone project which involves making a guide for programming the esp8266 chip. This is a very cheap (< $5 USD) device which has full wi-fi functionality and hardware interfaces, making it ideal for experimenting with Internet of Things applications.

The current version of the guide is in the project wiki, while the repository itself contains a mixture of code snippits we're working on and spikes. The guide is closed for submissions until the conclusion of our project, after which we are hoping to release it on an open content license such as CC-A.

Feel free to message us if you have any queries or want to provide feedback.

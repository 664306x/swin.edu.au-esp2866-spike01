### Introduction

Thank you for participating in our testing! The aim of this project is to design a guide for people who are interested in building Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The guide will use the ESP8266 chip, which was released in late 2014 and can be purchased very cheaply (less than 5 USD). The guide is intended for people new to working with hardware, though we hope it will be of use to people who have more experience and wish to get up and running with the ESP8266 quickly. Ideally, you will have the following minimum background:

- Enough programming experience to be able to do statements, conditional statements, loops and functions in any programming language
- Enough networking experience that you could configure a PC or other device with an address manually.

We will first get you to read and fill out a consent form. After this, we have a pre-test questionnaire to complete, and then the test itself where you will be reading through and following the guide, as well as answering a couple of supplemental questions. There will be another short survey at the end where you will get to provide feedback to us on what you thought of the guide. Please be as honest as you can!

# Consent form

## Your Rights

Please read the following section carefully. It will explain your rights in undertaking this testing.

### Your right to withdraw participation

You have the right to withdraw your participation in the testing at any time. If you wish to stop because you feel uncomfortable, or for any other reason, please let the test supervisor know immediately. If you are comfortable telling the test supervisor your reasons for why you wish to stop, please do so. You can also optionally choose to fill out the end questionnaire after stopping.

### Your right to privacy

You have the right for all personal information collected about you to be kept private. None of the identifying information you have provided will be made public at any stage. Instead, your pre- and post- survey questionnaires and test data will be anonymised - separated from your identifying information and matched only by the user ID filled out by the test supervisor at the front of this document.

### Your right to safety

You have the right to be safe from physical, mental and emotional harm, and your safety is paramount. We do not anticipate any negative side-effects from participating in this study. If at any stage you become concerned for your physical, mental and/or emotional wellbeing, please discontinue the test immediately and let the test supervisor know. Feel free to raise any potential issues at any time with the test supervisor.

#### Thanks again for your participation!

Open Issues

problem		- The application cannot run (with or without compiling) due to 'not enough memory'
solution	- An extremly trimmed down version was created by taking parts out piecemeal until the esp8266 would run it.
       		this version has had the following removed,
			- wifi connection (its just acting like a normal micro controller now)
			- config (everything is hard coded)
			- MQTT related code
			- all comments
			- shortcut global variables

problem		- the microphone sensor is extremly difficult to use due to sensativity issues.
		the sensor seems to trigger with noise, sometimes. if the noise continues it also untriggers anyway.
solution	- the microphone component is no longer included. It is recommended a different sensor take its place, specifically
		a flow control. [http://tronixlabs.com/water-flow/]
